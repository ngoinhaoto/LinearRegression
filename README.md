# Linear Regression Submission
### Ex2: Program to find w(using example and formula W = (X.T*X)^-1 * X.T * y from the video) by using Linear Regression
- Check the LinearRegression.ipynb
### Ex3: Use Batch Gradient Descent to find Theta(W), also provided somewhat similar result(theta=[31.98, 1.84] compared to theta = [34.04, 1.89] by using Linear Regression), but BGD can be used for bigger and more complex data
